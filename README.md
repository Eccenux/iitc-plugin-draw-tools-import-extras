# IITC plugin: Import extras for Draw Tools

Importing portal list to draw tools. Normally draw tools requires using a specific format.

See also: [my other IITC plugins](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AEccenux+iitc-plugin&type=Repositories).

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have IITC just &rarr; **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-draw-tools-import-extras/raw/master/my-plugin/dist/script.user.js)**.

Usage
-----------

Open portal details and use "DrawTool Import" link.

This plugin allows you to use a simple list like below (this draws an eight digit in ÅŒme, Japan):
```
35.788483,139.274883
35.783632,139.280273
35.779879,139.275345
35.786075,139.268
35.791965,139.281627
35.795736,139.275841
35.792506,139.270196
35.786311,139.278138
```

You don't have remove empty lines. So for example you can copy from FS passocode spread sheet (even if you are still missing some portals).

Development
